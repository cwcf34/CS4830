            API - lets a user login through soundcloud to your website

            Allows your to ado alot such as edit their profile
            SC.connect(function() {
                SC.put('/me', {
                user: { description: 'I am using the SoundCloud API!' }
              }

            And this could let you share to other social networks that are connect to your soundcloud
            SC.connect(function() {
              SC.post('/tracks/123/shared-to/connections', {
                connections: [ { id: 456 } ],
                  sharing-note: 'Check out my new sound'
